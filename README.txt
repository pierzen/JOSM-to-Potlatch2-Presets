This script automates most of Presets conversion from Josm to Potlatch2.
Note that Relation tags are not converted actually by the script.

Also,the conversion has to be completed manually to group the elements in
various menu TABS. This is done, with Potlach2, with the category attribute.

In the master file map_features.xml, Features sub-groups that are common to
many features can also be placed in InputSets.
